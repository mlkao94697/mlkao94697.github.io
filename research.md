My PhD work is mainly focused on using dead stars called white dwarfs to probe stellar and planetary interiors. My research aims to answer big questions like: 

- What are the geological and evolutionary stories of exoplanets?
- What will happen to our Solar System when the Sun dies?
- How does the white dwarf cooling process affect our age estimates of the Galaxy?

## Current Research

### Machine Learning and White Dwarfs in Gaia DR3



### Photometric Observations of Crystallizing Pulsating White Dwarfs
