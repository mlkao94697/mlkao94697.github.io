My PhD work is mainly focused on using dead stars called white dwarfs to probe stellar and planetary interiors. My research encompasses big questions like: 

- What are the geological and evolutionary stories of exoplanets?
- What will happen to our Solar System when the Sun dies?
- How does the white dwarf cooling process affect our age estimates of the Galaxy?

## Current Research

### Applying Machine Learning to White Dwarfs in Gaia DR3

All stars that are found to host exoplanets (so far) are intermediate to low mass stars, meaning they are approximately less than ten times as massive as the Sun. The evolutionary pathway for these stars, which make up about 95% of all stars in the universe, ulitmately ends at the white dwarf phase. Incredibly, some white dwarfs have been found with heavy metals in their atmospheres, signifying that they are actively swallowing up rocky debris from a destroyed planet or planetesimal.
