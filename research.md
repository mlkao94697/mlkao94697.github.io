My PhD work is mainly focused on using dead stars called white dwarfs to probe stellar and planetary interiors. My research encompasses big questions like: 

- What are the geological and evolutionary stories of exoplanets?
- What will happen to our Solar System when the Sun dies?
- How does the white dwarf cooling process affect our age estimates of the Galaxy?

All stars that are found to host exoplanets (so far) are intermediate to low mass stars, meaning they are approximately less than ten times as massive as the Sun. The evolutionary pathway for these stars, which make up about 95% of all stars in the universe, ulitmately ends at the white dwarf phase. Incredibly, some white dwarfs have been found with heavy metals in their atmospheres, signifying that they are actively swallowing up rocky debris from a destroyed planet or planetesimal. _**I am interested in studying these white dwarfs whose atmospheres are "polluted" by rocky material to understand the geological and evolutionary diversity of planets across our Galaxy.**_

  Historically, finding polluted white dwarfs in spectroscopic surveys is difficult due to their faintness.

Most white dwarfs are around 60% the mass of the Sun, but there are some rare ultra-massive white dwarfs that approach or exceed one solar mass. As white dwarfs cool, their cores begin to crystallize and they eventually transform into Earth-sized diamonds. Since higher mass white dwarfs have higher central densities, the point at which they begin to crystallize occurs much sooner in their cooling lifetimes than for a "normal" white dwarf. _**I am interested in studying the interior structure of the ultra-massive white dwarfs to investigate how crystallization affects the cooling process.**_
