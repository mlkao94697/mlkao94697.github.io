My PhD work is mainly focused on using dead stars called white dwarfs to probe stellar and planetary interiors. My research encompasses big questions like: 

- What are the geological and evolutionary stories of exoplanets?
- What will happen to our Solar System when the Sun dies?
- How does the white dwarf cooling process affect our age estimates of the Galaxy?

All stars that are found to host exoplanets (so far) are intermediate to low mass stars, meaning they are approximately less than ten times as massive as the Sun. The evolutionary pathway for these stars, which make up about 95% of all stars in the universe, ulitmately ends at the white dwarf phase. Incredibly, some white dwarfs have been found with heavy metals in their atmospheres, signifying that they are actively swallowing up rocky debris from a destroyed planet or planetesimal. _**I am interested in studying these white dwarfs whose atmospheres are "polluted" by rocky material to understand the geological and evolutionary diversity of planets across our Galaxy.**_ 

- #### Applying Machine Learning to White Dwarfs in Gaia DR3

  Historically, finding cool polluted white dwarfs in spectroscopic surveys is difficult due to their faintness. What's special about the cool polluted white dwarfs is that they tend to exhibit multiple metal species in their atmospheres which we can use to characterize the interior of the destroyed planet. But how do we sift through large telescopic surveys like *Gaia* that contain over a billion stars and hundreds of thousands of white dwarfs to find what we want?

  One way to do this is with _**machine learning**_!

  The type of machine learning I use is called *unsupervised* machine learning, which takes in unlabeled data and organizes it without the need for a prior training dataset. Similar data is clumped together while dissimlar data is separated from each other. Using the Gaia BP-RP (XP) spectra for 100,000 white dwarfs and an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), we end up with a 2D map, shown in the figure below. 

  You can find my paper on using UMAP with Gaia XP spectra here!

  *HET spectrum*

Most white dwarfs are around 60% the mass of the Sun, but there are some rare ultra-massive white dwarfs that approach or exceed one solar mass. As white dwarfs cool, their cores begin to crystallize and they eventually transform into Earth-sized diamonds. Since higher mass white dwarfs have higher central densities, the point at which they begin to crystallize occurs much sooner in their cooling lifetimes than for a "normal" white dwarf. _**I am interested in studying the interior structure of the ultra-massive white dwarfs to investigate how crystallization affects the cooling process.**_

- #### Photometric Observations of Crystallizing Pulsating White Dwarfs

  For my second year research project, I began a survey of the massive and ultramssive pulsating white dwarfs, which are very rare and difficult to find. The mass-radius relationship for white dwarfs differs greatly from main sequence stars like the Sun, in that adding more mass to a white dwarf results in shrinking of the radius. An important feature of the massive pulsators is that they can be used to probe the effects of core crystallization through a technique called *asteroseismology*. 


## Past Research

As an undergraduate and Master's student at New Mexico Tech, I completed a three-year internship at Sandia National Laboratories where I worked on measuring the room temperature iron (Fe) opacity.
