<p>I am a 4th-year Astronomy graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin and am working with Professors Keith Hawkins and Don Winget on using white dwarf stars to study stellar and planetary evolution. I primarily use observational methods to study different aspects of white dwarf anatomy - from asteroseismology to study their interiors to spectroscopy to study their atmospheres. I am a prolific user of the 2.1-m Otto Struve telescope and Hobby-Eberly telescope at McDonald Observatory, and have discovered several new members of the ultra-massive crystallizing pulsating white dwarfs and of the white dwarfs that are accreting planetary remains. A big part of my research includes melding AI and large telescopic surveys to uncover different types of white dwarfs - like the cool metal-polluted white dwarfs - that are typically difficult to find using conventional methods. 

</p>I received my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Physics at the New Mexico Instiute of Mining and Technology (a.k.a. New Mexico Tech) in Socorro, NM. I completed a 3-year internship during my time at New Mexico Tech at Sandia National laboratories under the supervision of Drs. Jim Bailey and Guillaume Loisel.</p>
